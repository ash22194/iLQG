# iLQR
Implementations of the iLQR algorithm

Based on "Control Limited Differential Dynamic Programming" Tassa, Yuval, Nicolas Mansard, and Emo Todorov, ICRA 2014.
Building on Yuval Tassa's implementation here: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52069-ilqg-ddp-trajectory-optimization
